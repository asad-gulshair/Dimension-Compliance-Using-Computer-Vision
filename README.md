# Dimension-Compliance-Using-Computer-Vision
This project focuses on dimension compliance inspection of disk-shaped objects using computer vision. The system automatically measures the inner and outer diameters of disks and compares them against defined standards.
To ensure accurate and scale-consistent measurements, ArUco markers are used as reference objects in images.

🔍 Key Features

Automated Diameter Measurement

Detects and measures both inner and outer diameters.

Annotation Pipeline

Collected image samples and annotated them for training.

ArUco Marker Integration

Ensures real-world unit measurement by using markers as scale references.

Dimension Compliance Check

Measured values can be compared with standard tolerances (e.g., ASME, ISO).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

OpenCV (for image processing, contour detection, ArUco marker detection)

YOLO / Object Detection (for disk and region localization)

NumPy & Pandas (for calculations & reporting)

📂 Dataset & Annotation

Images of disk samples were collected under controlled conditions.

Each image contains an ArUco marker for scaling.

Annotations include:

Outer boundary (disk edge)

Inner boundary (hole/center cut)

📏 Measurement Workflow

Detect ArUco marker → calculate pixel-to-mm ratio.

Detect disk edges using segmentation / bounding boxes.

Measure inner & outer diameters in millimeters.

Compare results against standard specifications.

📊 Example Output

Input: Disk image with ArUco marker

Output:

Outer Diameter: XX mm

Inner Diameter: YY mm

Compliance: ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail

🚀 Future Improvements

Integrate more flange types and disk variants.

Build a real-time inspection system with video input.

Develop a web dashboard for compliance reporting.
